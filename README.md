## Dependencies

Install the following (assuming you run ROS Kinetic):

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-control-toolbox ros-kinetic-controller-manager ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros-control ros-kinetic-hector-xacro-tools ros-kinetic-hector-gazebo-plugins ros-kinetic-gps-common ros-kinetic-robot-pose-ekf ros-kinetic-joint-state-controller ros-kinetic-effort-controllers ros-kinetic-position-controllers

## Compilation and setup

Simply place the packages in your ROS workspace, and compile using catkin_make.

To start a simulation two additional packages are required. Therefore change into your workspace source directory and clone the repositories:

 * gazebo_ros_control_selected_joint: https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/gazebo_ros_control_select_joints.git

 * roboticsgroup_gazebo_plugin: https://github.com/roboticsgroup/roboticsgroup_gazebo_plugins.git


## Simulation bringup

To start the simulation execute the following command:

* roslaunch taurob_tracker_bringup bringup.launch

### Running simulation in docker. 

The repository includes a Dockerfile that can be used to quickly build...

```
sudo docker build -t tracker_simulation .
```

... and run...

```
sudo docker run -ti -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix tracker_simulation
```

... the simulation.

## Moving the robot

To move the robot base the following topics are available:

* /taurob_tracker/cmd_vel_raw

* /taurob_tracker/joint_flipper_position_controller/command
